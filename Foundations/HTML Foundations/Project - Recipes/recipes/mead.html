    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The earliest surviving description of mead is possibly the soma mentioned in the hymns of the Rigveda,
        one of the sacred books of the historical Vedic religion and (later) Hinduism dated around 1700–1100 BCE.
        Aristotle discussed mead made in Illiria in his Meteorologica and elsewhere, while Pliny the Elder called mead militites 
        in his Naturalis Historia, and differentiated wine sweetened with honey or "honey-wine" from mead.
    </p>
    <p>The Roman naturalist Columella gave a recipe for mead in De re rustica, about 60 CE: </p>
    <blockquote>
        Take rainwater kept for several years, and mix a sextarius of this water with a [Roman] pound of honey. 
        For a weaker mead, mix a sextarius of water with nine ounces of honey. The whole is exposed to the sun for 40 days, 
        and then left on a shelf near the fire. If you have no rain water, then boil spring water.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Funnel</li>
        <li>Demijohn to ferment in</li>
        <li>Airlock and bung for demijohn</li>
        <li>Short length of tubing</li>
        <li>Big food safe bucket – make sure it can handle boiling water (c.10 litres)</li>
        <li>Large metal spoon</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750g of honey of your choice (more flavoursome the better)</li>
        <li>Sachet of brewer’s or wine yeast</li>
        <li>Extra honey to back-sweeten</li>
        <li>25g of no rinse sanitiser powder e.g. SureSan (Sodium Percarbonate)</li>
        <li>Acid regulator e.g. citric acid at 1g/ltr (so 5g for a 5l batch)</li>
        <li>Yeast nutrients 2g/litre (so 10g for a 5l batch)</li>
        <li>2 Campden tablets</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Sterilising</h3>
    <p>As with all fermentation, it’s important to have a clean, sterile environment so the yeast grows, but nothing else does.</p>
    <p>So, before you start, wash down your work space with warm soapy water. It's also a good idea to wash all your equipment in warm soapy water 
        if you haven’t used it in a while. Read more about how to clean brewing equipment to keep your kit in tip-top shape.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bucket, mix the sanitisation powder as per the instructions on the packet with 5 litres of water to create a sanitising solution.</li>
        <li>Pour a portion of this solution into the demijohn and swirl around for a few moments to sanitize the fermenter. 
            Empty this back into the bucket, making sure there’s none left in the fermenter.</li>
        <li>Sanitize the funnel, the bung, spoon, and airlock by placing them in the solution in the bucket.</li>
        <li>Remove the equipment from the bucket and place it on your clean work surface. The funnel can sit on top of the demijohn 
            to keep it from touching dirty surfaces. Pour away the sanitisation solution in the sink.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your bucket, demijohn and lid, and other equipment should now be sanitized and ready to brew with.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Making the Mead</h3>
    <p>These instructions produce a light session mead at around 4%, this means we’re going to start with 150g of honey per litre (so for 5 litres that’s 750g).</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 5 litres of boiled water to the sterilised and rinsed bucket.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast nutrient and acid regulator, and stir to dissolve using the spoon.</li>
        <li>Now, add the honey to the boiled water and stir again until all the honey has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Leave the liquid to cool for a while so it doesn't damage or crack your demijohn, then transfer using the funnel.</li>
        <li>Leave your liquid to cool down to room temperature before pitching the yeast.</li>
        <li>Rehydrate your yeast according to the packet, and leave for 5 mins. Add to your demijohn and shake gently to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the airlock to the demijohn, fill the airlock with water and leave in a cool dark place where it won’t be disturbed for 2-3 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How do I know if it's Worked?</h2>
    <p>You’ll know your yeast pitch was successful if after about 6 hrs, when gas starts to bubble out of your airlock. 
        This is CO2, which is a natural by-product of fermentation, and the reason beer has bubbles in it.
        As the fermentation progresses, you will notice a layer of sediment building up at the bottom of your fermenter. 
        This is dead and dormant yeast, and is completely normal. It can be removed to increase clarity and taste.
