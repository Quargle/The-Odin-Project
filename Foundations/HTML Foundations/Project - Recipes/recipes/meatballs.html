    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Sweden, meatballs are called köttbullar (literally "meat buns"). They come in a few different types, all typically small, 
        and the international influence is great, perhaps the greatest from Sweden and Spain. They are usually eaten with potatoes. 
        Some common additions are vegetables, ketchup, spices, etc. They are made with ground beef or a mix of ground beef, pork and 
        sometimes veal or venison, finely chopped (fried) onions, some broth, often with cream and sometimes with breadcrumbs soaked in milk. 
        They are seasoned with white pepper and salt and sometimes allspice and herbs.</p>
    <p>Swedish meatballs are traditionally served with gravy, boiled or mashed potatoes, lingonberry jam, and sometimes pickled cucumber.</p>
